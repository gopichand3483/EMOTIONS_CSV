# EMOTIONS_CSV

This is a small project I worked on where I trained a Support Vector Machine model to classify human emotions based on text. The idea was to understand how machines can interpret what we feel, using the words we write or speak.

I used a dataset of text samples labeled with emotions. After cleaning the data and converting the text into numbers (TF-IDF), I trained the SVM model and checked how well it performed.

This isn’t meant to be a perfect model. I just wanted to explore the flow of building something that can guess emotions using machine learning. Maybe in future, I’ll try deep learning or build a better pipeline.

The notebook includes all the steps from loading data to evaluating the model. You can open it and follow along.

Let me know if you have any thoughts or suggestions. I'm always open to learning and improving.
